    <string name="privacy_policy_text"><b>Havmor Privacy Policy</b>\n\nWe want you to enjoy every visit to havmor.com. Any information you share with us will be carefully guarded, whether you’re here to participate in a contest, browse our flavours, find your local store or apply for a Havmor franchise. We encrypt your credit card number, ordering and shipping information and other personal information, including your favorite flavour, through our industry-standard security software. Please read on for more details about our Privacy Policy.\n\nHavmor reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Be sure to check this page periodically for updates. This policy applies only to personal information collected online at Havmor.com and does not apply to information collected offline by Havmor.\n\nWhat kind of information we ask for and why\n\n<b>Inquiries.</b>\n\nTo best respond to your comments when you request information from Havmor or share an experience you had at one of our stores, we’ll ask for personal information. This includes your name, address and email address, as well as local store address and any other information you may wish to share.\n\n<b>Promotional Events.</b>\n\nWhen you choose to take part in a promotional event we’ll ask for information necessary for the event, such as your name, email address and shipping address. On occasion, we may co-sponsor promotions with third parties. Before entering your data you will be notified if third parties will obtain your personal information.\n\n<b>Surveys.</b>\n\nFrom time-to-time we may post surveys which request demographic information such as age range, gender, areas of interest and familiarity with Havmor products and services, as well as customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary. With each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information. This information will be used to create new flavors and treats, plus improve the overall experience on Havmor.com.\n\n<b>Franchise Applications.</b>\n\nIf you choose, you may submit an electronic application seeking consideration as a prospective franchisee via the Hav funn Franchise Opportunity Web site. If you submit an electronic application, we will collect your name, date of birth, address, email address, other contact information and certain financial and employment information that you must enter on the form. By submitting this information, you agree that Havmor may retain, use and disclose the information to respond to your inquiry and to help us conduct our franchise marketing efforts. Information on your online form will become part of any application for a Havmor franchise that you might later submit. We may disclose your personal information to our business units, agents, parent company, other affiliates and to other third parties as part of our consideration of your inquiry or any subsequent franchise application. We do not authorize unaffiliated third parties to use your personal information for any purpose other than consideration of your inquiry or application.\n\n<b>Aggregate Information.</b>\n\nWe collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Web site whenever you visit us online. Aggregate Information includes various forms of “click stream” information, such as entry and exit points for our Web site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, operating system and browser type. In addition, when you request pages on our Web site, our servers automatically log your IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your web service whenever you are surfing the Web.\n\nTraffic directed to Havmor.com from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic is also tracked by third-party software. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase.\n\nThis Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this Policy.\n\n<b>Email Updates</b>\n\nIf you decide to take part in any of Havmor contest, you’ll have the choice to receive occasional updates about our site, as well as special offers for savings at your local Havmor. If at any time you decide you’d rather not receive emails from Havmor, you can unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any Havmor email.\n\n<b>Disclosures</b>\n\nNone of your personal information will be given to anyone outside of Havmor and our affiliates, other than our agents who may need to fulfill your order, respond to your requests or inquiries, help us improve our products or website or otherwise carry out our instructions. We may disclose the personal information you submit on a franchise application to our business units, agents, parent company, other affiliates and to third parties as part of our consideration of that application and to help conduct our franchise marketing efforts. We require our agents to respect our privacy practices and not use your personal information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions.\n\nHavmor reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.\n\n<b>Company Sale</b>Information collected through our Web site is considered a trade secret of Havmor. As the owner of such information, we may disclose or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets.\n\n<b>Franchising Information</b>\n\nFor franchise information on Havmor, please visit our Franchise Opportunities section on Havmor.com.\n\n<b>Children’s Information</b>\n\nHavmor recognizes the need to provide additional privacy protection to children. Children 12-years-old and younger may visit Havmor.com without disclosing any personally identifiable information. However, it is sometimes necessary to collect some personally identifiable information about children in order to allow them to use a feature of our site (like taking part in a contest). In addition, be aware that all sites that are targeted to children 12 and younger are prohibited by law from collecting more information than they need.\n\nOnly a parent or guardian may register such information. When a parent registers a child, we request the child’s name, date of birth and parent’s e-mail address. We collect this information in order to verify the details.\n\nWe will not disclose any children’s information to anyone outside of Havmor, our affiliates, and our agents and franchisees. Our agents may need children’s personal information in order to fill an order, respond to a request or to support, prevent fraud, or assist us in the management and improvement of our Web site. Our franchisees may need children’s personal information in order to help us provide correct information and prevent fraud. We require our agents and franchisees to respect our privacy practices concerning children’s information and not use children’s information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions.\n\nParents may request at any time that we delete information about their children from our databases.\n\n<b>How we protect your personal and financial information.</b>\n\nWhen you enter your credit card number or personal and financial information, we use a sophisticated software program (Norton Secured powered by VeriSign) to encrypt or scramble that information before it’s sent so that even if anyone intercepts the information, it is highly unlikely that they will be able to read or use it. In addition, we take appropriate security measures to safeguard your personal information once we have received it.\n\n<b>Cookies</b>\n\nLike many other Web sites, we use “cookie” technology to improve your experience at our site. Cookies are small pieces of data that we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies are not themselves personally identifiable, but may be linked to personal information that you provide to us through your interaction at our site.\n\n<b>Links</b>\n\nYou may find that it is possible to link from other Web sites to this, the official Havmor Website, or from this Web site to other Web sites. Those other Web sites are not under our control. Havmor is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites. You should consult the privacy policy of the Web site to or from which you link to determine the information practices of that Website.\n\n<b>International</b>\n\nHavmor controls and operates this Web site from within the India. Our online privacy practices are governed by the Indian laws, which may differ from privacy laws in your state or home country. By submitting your personal information to this site, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to any country and its use and disclosure in accordance with Indian law and with this privacy policy.\n\nThis English-language privacy policy is Havmor’ official statement of its online privacy practices. In case of any inconsistency between this English-language privacy policy and its translation into another language, this English-language document shall control.\n\n</string>
